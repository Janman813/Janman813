## My Life...
In my life I have always had some form of the Arts around me. My Uncle David was a musician and also taught at a university in chicago. This man wanted to make sure we got more out of lifes creation since we lived in a small town in Pennsylvania. It made trips a little boring when you are not understanding whats going on at a young age, but you will always be grateful for the moments and the art that was shown to you. One thing my father would tell you my Uncle would swear by is "If you do not know your music you will not get a girl" music has been more of an infulance on my familly and it is great. Yet, I choose to go a different route and explore the arts in a new way. By creating this website for my class I will be using it as a blog of what i create and a little explation on what it means to me. I will talk a little bit about myself and share what I have created/worked on. I hope to someday use this site in hopes of a demonstration of my work. If you have any questions please contact my Instagram Art99_23.
