            The private arts institution The Royal Academy of Arts was
            founded by George III on 10 December 1768, at the behest of architect
            Sir William Chambers. Chambers and other artists and
            architects sought to establish a British national "society for promoting the
            Arts of Design," a society that would sponsor an annual exhibition (later the
            Summer Exhibition) as well as a School of Design (later the Royal Academy
            Schools.) Thirty-four founding members were elected; today, the society elects
            no more than 80 members at one time as Royal Academicians (Members of the Royal
            Academy, RA). During Mitford’s time, the Royal Academy was housed at Somerset House, a building designed and
            built by Chambers beginning in 1776 and likely not
            completed until after 1819. The institution moved
            to Trafalgar Square in the 1830s, to share space with the newly-founded 
            <orgName xml:id="86"></orgName>National
            Gallery, and remained there until 1867.
            Mitford’s friend and correspondent Benjamin Robert

         The private arts institution The Royal Academy of Arts was
         founded by George III on 10 December 1768, at the behest of architect
         Sir William Chambers. Chambers and other artists and
         architects sought to establish a British national "society for promoting the
         Arts of Design," a society that would sponsor an annual exhibition (later the
         Summer Exhibition) as well as a School of Design (later the Royal Academy
         Schools.) Thirty-four founding members were elected; today, the society elects
         no more than 80 members at one time as Royal Academicians (Members of the Royal
         Academy, RA). During Mitford’s time, the Royal Academy was housed at Somerset House, a building designed and
         built by Chambers beginning in 1776 and likely not
         completed until after 1819. The institution moved
         to Trafalgar Square in the 1830s, to share space with the newly-founded 
         <orgName xml:id="86"></orgName>National
         Gallery, and remained there until 1867.
         Mitford’s friend and correspondent Benjamin Robert
         Haydon, was a Member of the Royal Academy.

         James II’s right to the throne of
         England, even though he was Catholic. The term connoted "Irish Catholic
         outlaw." The term was adopted by the party, which became generally
         affiliated with the interests of the country gentry, Anglicanism, and
         support of the divine right of kings. The party was loosely affiliated until
         the late 18th century, when William Pitt the Younger
         emerged as the leader of a revitalized party. The Conservative Party,
         founded in 1834 by Sir Robert Peel,
         absorbed and organized the Tory Party and retained the party nickname.
